# I think I should be using 
# - 3.11d of Barreda for lig. indep gating 
# - 3.24a/b for lig dep gating 
# for in between these regimes SOmehow need to compute kE generally, but should be able to evoke steady state somewhere and assume fast/slow gating  limits 

# inputs
Va = 1 
Veff=1 
wf=1 
wb=1

# load files 
# compute outer problem 
# give lig induced, fast/slow gatining
