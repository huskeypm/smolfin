Smolfin is a tool for estimating diffusion-limited reactions between a 
substrate and enzyme, based on the Smoluchowski electrodiffusion equation. 
The software utilizes atomistic resolution structural data for the enzyme, 
the electrostatic potential from Poisson-Boltzmann solvers like APBS 
(http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/apbs), and is based on the FEnICs finite 
element solver (http://fenicsproject.org/). Smolfin was recently used to model 
Ca2+ association with the myofilament Ca2+ sensor Troponin C and the 
Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase Ca2+ transporter [1]
